# NoisySignalIntegration.jl

*NoisySignalIntegration.jl -- A tool to determine uncertainty in numeric
integrals of noisy data.*

`NoisySignalIntegration` implements a method to determine the uncertainty in
numeric integrals of noisy data on the basis of a Monte-Carlo process. A
predecessor of this package was originally intended to estimate uncertainties of
band signals in FTIR spectra (see [G. Karir et al.,
2019](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9CP00435A)), which is reflected in the example
given in the usage guide.
