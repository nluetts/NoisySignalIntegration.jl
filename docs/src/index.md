# NoisySignalIntegration.jl

*NoisySignalIntegration.jl -- A tool to determine uncertainty in numeric integrals of noisy data.*

`NoisySignalIntegration` is a package that implements a method to determine the uncertainty in numeric integrals
of noisy data on the basis of a Monte-Carlo process. The package was originally intended to estimate uncertainties
of band signals in FTIR spectra (see [G. Karir et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9CP00435A)),
which is reflected in the example given in the usage guide.
