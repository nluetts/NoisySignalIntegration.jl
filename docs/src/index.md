# NoisySignalIntegrals.jl

*NoisySignalIntegrals.jl -- A tool to determine uncertainty in numeric integrals of noisy data.*

`NoisySignalIntegrals` is a package that implements a method to determine the uncertainty in numeric integrals of noisy data on the basis of a Monte-Carlo process.

The package was originally intended to estimate uncertainties of band signals in FTIR
spectra, which is reflected in the example given in the usage guide.
